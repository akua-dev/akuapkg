# Example 06 — multi-engine

Four source engines composed in one Package, with per-source output routing. Demonstrates:

- `webapp.template(...)` — a Helm chart consumed unchanged via the synthesized `charts.<name>` stub
- `kustomize.build(...)` — a Kustomize overlay on a base (engine-direct: bases are within-Package, not deps)
- `rgd.instantiate(...)` — a kro RGD rendered offline (no controller)
- Inline KCL resources — just dicts, composed with the rest
- Named outputs — static resources routed to raw manifests, runtime-late-binding resources routed to an RGD for kro to reconcile

This is the "realistic monorepo Package" shape. Most production Packages have 2–5 sources; 4 is a reasonable teaching number.

## Layout

```

├── akua.toml
├── akua.lock
├── package.k                      the Package; mixes Helm + Kustomize + kro + inline KCL
├── overlays/                      Kustomize overlay (local source)
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── servicemonitor-patch.yaml
├── inputs.yaml
└── README.md
```

## The Package, in pieces

### Imports

```python
import akua.kustomize
import akua.rgd
import charts.webapp    as webapp
import rgds.platform    as platform
```

`charts.webapp` resolves to an OCI-published Helm chart via `akua.toml`; the synthesized stub owns the `template` method, so `import akua.helm` doesn't appear at the call site. `rgds.platform` resolves to an OCI-published kro `ResourceGraphDefinition`. `akua.kustomize` / `akua.rgd` stay engine-direct because their inputs aren't typed deps — the kustomize base is a within-Package directory, the RGD is instantiated against an OCI artifact.

### Four sources

- **Helm** — the webapp chart, values mapped from the public schema.
- **Kustomize** — a local overlay under `./overlays/`, building a `ServiceMonitor` + a patched ConfigMap.
- **kro RGD** — the platform glue (e.g. app-scoped DNS record + cert) instantiated with the current App's metadata. `kro.rgd(...)` produces the ResourceGraphDefinition as a regular K8s manifest; kro's controller picks it up from the rendered YAML.
- **Inline KCL** — a `NetworkPolicy` authored directly in KCL. No external engine needed.

### Aggregation

```python
_app     = webapp.template(webapp.TemplateOpts { values = webapp.Values { ... } })
_monitor = kustomize.build(kustomize.Build { path = "./overlays" })
_netpol  = NetworkPolicy { ... }
_glue    = kro.rgd(kro.Rgd { definition = platform.RGD, instance = { ... } })

resources = [*_app, *_monitor, _netpol, _glue]
```

One Package, one flat resource list, one render output. ArgoCD/Flux
applies the rendered YAML as it would any other manifest set; kro's
controller sees the RGD and reconciles its instances.

## Render

```sh
akuapkg add                         # resolve deps
akuapkg render --inputs inputs.yaml --out ./deploy
```

Result:

```

├── 000-deployment-webapp.yaml          # from helm
├── 001-service-webapp.yaml             # from helm
